    "## Introduction -\n",
    "The Arlington 2050 project is a year long initiative that strives to get community feedback on what Arlington should look like in 2050 and the challenges we must address to get there. Rachael and I worked specifically with the Postcard test tracker dataset. This specific dataset had data collected from many locations. These ranged from local librarys, to community events. Our data was collected strictly on postcards at said locations, whether that be in person or dropped in a box.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ingesting and Cleaning Data -\n",
    "First, we took into account the fact we had hundreds of entries from multiple different locations. Due to the fact we had entries from multiple different locations in the county we had a little extra work when it came to cleaning the data. We needed to make sure that each location had its own dataframe, this would make getting specifics on certain locations easier. We achieved this by creating a new dataframe for each location."
