# Sorting

- Sorting played a key role in the development of the computer. 

- The first code ever written for a stored program was a sorting program, an efficient sorting program. 

- The sorting program helped the government realize that their investment in the IBM was in fact worth it. 

- The main reason things get sorted is to be shown in a useful way to the human eye. 

- Sorted information is in our everyday lives, for instance emails, Facebook, blogs, etc. 

- Size matters when it comes to sorting. 
    - The more you take on, the worse it gets. 
    - The bigger the thing you are sorting, the less efficient the sorting gets.

- The method of sorting is extremely important as it determines how fast or slow it will take (how many passes it will have to make though the dataset before it is sorted).

- **Specific Library Examples**:
    - The Preston Sort Center, one of the biggest and most efficient book sorting facilities in the world. The books going through its system are sorted on linear time (O(n)).
    - The Preston Sort Center uses an algorithm known as **Bucket Sort** instead of Mergesort which runs on linearithmic time. 
    - They do this by sorting the books into a number of sorted categories. 
    
    - UC Berkeley's Doe and Moffitt Libraries sorts returned books by hand. They do this by loading these books onto carts, with up to 150 books in proper order, so they can be returned to the shelves. 
    - The students that sort these books have minimal sorting training, they develop their own strategies leading them to sort the car of 150 books in less than 40 minutes.

- Make sure that sorting is worth the time; don't sort something you'll never search, and it's inefficient to search something you'll never sort.
